* Support Emacs community developers

Consider supporting the developers behind Emacs, great packages and educational resources. Often, a package is used by tens of thousands of people while the maintainers can barely pay the bills.

** Steve Purcell
Creator of [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] and a popular "[[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][purcell/emacs.d]]" config.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I've worked hard since 2012 to make MELPA the best place to find high-quality emacs lisp packages for any workflow, and thousands of people use my own elisp packages and my popular Emacs configuration. Beyond Emacs, I'm a contributor to dozens of other active developer tooling projects across many languages.

I always take extra time to help other developers level up, and to model how I believe every inclusive, friendly open source community should work. I do this for love, but it means a lot to me that some people appreciate my contributions enough to become patrons - thank you!

** Jonas Bernoulli
Maintainer of [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an Emacs package. Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain. While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from within Emacs.

I've been maintaining Magit since mid-2013, and like to think that it took a huge leap forward during that time.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I write a [[https://fuco1.github.io/][blog]] about Emacs (and other things).

While working towards my financial independence, an additional income stream means I can do less contracting work and focus more on Emacs and the community, something I am very passionate about.

I give willingly, and strive to give as much as I can, after I do my 9-to-5 job that lets me stay alive. With enough success of my donation campaign, I could switch to a 4 days per week work. Having one whole day per week to be free to do what I want would mean very much to me: I could undertake more complex tasks that require multiple hours of concentrated work, instead of just doing 1-2 hours of maintenance work every evening after a full work day.

Creator and maintainer of [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Maintaining Helm requires a lot of work, which I have done voluntarily since 2011. As it demands lots of my time it gets increasingly difficult maintaining it without financial help.

Thanks to all the people that are helping or have helped Helm development, but they are actually too few to continue serenely. By the way, after the release of version 3.0 I will have to stop developing Helm seriously until I get enough financial support, only providing a minimal bugfix maintenance. Thanks for your understanding If you feel Helm is making your daily work easier, please consider making a donation.

Thank you!
